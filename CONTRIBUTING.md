   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Get Approval**: Wait for at least one code review approval before merging

## Coding Standards

### C# / .NET Standards

- Follow [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private fields
- Keep methods focused and follow single responsibility principle
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML comments for public APIs
- Keep files under 500 lines when possible

**Linting Rules** (enforced via StyleCop and Roslynator):
- Follow StyleCop rules (see `.editorconfig`)
- Use `var` when the type is obvious from context
- Use expression-bodied members when appropriate
- Prefer early returns to reduce nesting

### TypeScript / React Standards

- Follow [TypeScript Coding Conventions](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-Guidelines)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and under 200 lines
- Use descriptive prop names and TypeScript interfaces
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use meaningful component and function names

**Linting Rules** (enforced via ESLint and Prettier):
- Follow ESLint rules (see `eslint.config.js`)
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Add trailing commas in multiline arrays/objects
- Use arrow functions for inline callbacks

### General Standards

- Write self-documenting code with clear names
- Add comments only when code cannot be made clearer
- Keep functions focused and small (ideally under 50 lines)
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Remove unused code and imports
- Format code before committing

## Commit Message Conventions

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without functionality changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `build`: Build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

**Scopes:**
- `backend`: Backend API changes
- `frontend`: Frontend application changes
- `api`: API changes
- `auth`: Authentication changes
- `payment`: Payment processing changes
- `search`: Search functionality
- `tests`: Test changes
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `deps`: Dependency updates

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add Google OAuth authentication
fix(payment): correct Stripe payment processing error
docs(api): update API endpoint documentation
refactor(backend): extract payment service interface
```

**Subject Guidelines:**
- Start with uppercase letter
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- No period at the end
- Be concise but descriptive

```

### Code Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: PR must pass all CI checks (build, tests, linting)
2. **Review Requirements**: At least one approval from a maintainer
3. **PR Size**: 
   - Extra Small (<100 lines): Quick review
   - Small (<300 lines): Standard review
   - Medium (<500 lines): Thorough review recommended
   - Large (<1000 lines): Breaking into smaller PRs encouraged
   - Extra Large (1000+): Must be broken into smaller PRs

4. **Review Guidelines**:
   - Be constructive and respectful
   - Comment on code, not the person
   - Suggest alternatives when possible
   - Ask questions if something is unclear
   - Approve when ready, request changes when needed

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- All domain logic must have unit tests
- Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Maintain at least 80% code coverage
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use meaningful test names (e.g., `Should_ReturnUser_When_ValidEmailIsProvided`)

### Integration Tests

- Test database operations with TestContainers
- Test external service integrations
- Use real database instances (not mocks)
- Clean up test data after execution

### End-to-End Tests

- Test critical user workflows
- Test authentication flows
- Test payment processing
- Test search functionality
- Use Playwright for browser automation

### Running Tests

**Backend Tests:**
```bash
cd src/backend
dotnet test
```
