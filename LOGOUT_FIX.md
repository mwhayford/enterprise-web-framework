# Logout Issue Fix

## Problem
When users clicked the logout button, they received a "Bad Request" error.

## Root Cause
The logout endpoint in `AuthController.cs` had the `[Authorize]` attribute, which required a valid JWT token to access the endpoint. This caused issues when:
- The token was expired or about to expire
- The token was invalid
- There were any authentication issues

When the logout request failed authorization, it returned a 401 Unauthorized error, which appeared as a bad request to the user.

## Solution
Removed the `[Authorize]` attribute from the `/api/auth/logout` endpoint.

### Code Change
**File**: `src/backend/RentalManager.API/Controllers/AuthController.cs`

**Before**:
```csharp
[HttpPost("logout")]
[Authorize]
public IActionResult Logout()
{
    // In a real application, you might want to blacklist the token
    return Ok(new { Message = "Logged out successfully" });
}
```

**After**:
```csharp
[HttpPost("logout")]
public IActionResult Logout()
{
    // In a real application, you might want to blacklist the token
    // No authorization required - users should be able to logout even with expired tokens
    return Ok(new { Message = "Logged out successfully" });
}
```

## Why This Works
- Users can now logout even if their token is expired or invalid
- The logout process clears the token from localStorage on the frontend
- The backend no longer validates the token before processing the logout request
- This is a common pattern for logout endpoints, as the purpose is to end the session regardless of token validity

## Frontend Logout Flow
The frontend logout process (in `src/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`):

1. Calls the backend `/api/auth/logout` endpoint
2. Removes the token from localStorage
3. Removes user data from localStorage
4. Sets the user state to null
5. Even if the API call fails, the user is still logged out locally (in the `finally` block)

## Testing
After this fix:
1. Login to the application
2. Click the Logout button
3. Should successfully logout without any errors
4. Should be redirected to the login page

## Deployment
The fix has been deployed to Docker Desktop:
- Backend container has been rebuilt
- Service is healthy and running
- Logout endpoint is now accessible without authentication

## Notes
- In production, you might want to implement token blacklisting or a token revocation list
- For JWT-based authentication, tokens remain valid until expiration even after logout
- Consider implementing refresh token rotation for enhanced security
