## 📝 Known Linter Notes

There are 3 ESLint warnings related to ARIA attributes that are false positives:
- `aria-expanded` in FAQItem.tsx
- `aria-expanded` in Navigation.tsx  
- `aria-checked` in LandingPage.tsx

These warnings appear because the linter expects string values for ARIA attributes, but React properly handles boolean values. The ESLint disable comments have been added to acknowledge these are intentional.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The following were listed in the plan but marked as future enhancements:
- Live chat widget integration
- Multi-language support (i18n)
- Dark mode toggle
- Video demo modal
- Blog integration
- Case studies page
- Actual product screenshots (currently using placeholders)

## 🎉 Success Metrics to Track

Once deployed, consider tracking these metrics:
- Pricing section view rate

7. Consider A/B testing different headlines and CTAs
