## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] Infrastructure deployed
- [x] Application running
- [x] Health checks passing
- [x] Database connectivity confirmed
- [x] Load balancing working
- [x] Security groups configured
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates (not configured)
- [ ] Custom domain names (not configured)
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting (basic CloudWatch only)
- [ ] Backup/disaster recovery (not configured)
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies (not configured)
- [ ] WAF/CloudFront (not configured)

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action Required**:
   ```powershell
   # Tear down to stop charges
   cd c:/src/Core
   .\scripts\teardown-staging.ps1
   ```
   **Reason**: Currently costing ~$0.27/hour. Tear down saves ~$189/month.

2. **Before Production**:
   - Deploy Kafka/Elasticsearch if needed
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Set up custom domains
   - Configure auto-scaling
   - Implement backup strategies
   - Add WAF and CloudFront
   - Configure monitoring/alerting

3. **For Future Testing**:
   ```powershell
   # Redeploy anytime
   .\scripts\deploy-staging.ps1  # Takes ~25 minutes
   
   # Test for a few hours
   # Run your tests
   
   # Tear down when done
   .\scripts\teardown-staging.ps1  # Takes ~15 minutes
   ```
